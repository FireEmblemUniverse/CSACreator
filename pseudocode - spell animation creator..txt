pseudocode - spell animation creator.

input = script

1. open file
  make sure it exists

2. create frame data event file
  C1F -> WORD 0x8500001F etc
  0x86 commands are
    O ObjImage.png (480x160, 16 colours indexed)
    B BGImage.png (256x160 (150?), 16 colours indexed)
    25
  becomes
  SHORT Duration
  BYTE index 0x86
  POIN OBJImage_index
  WORD (FGOAM*12) (BGOAM*12)
  POIN BGImage_index OBJPalette_index BGPalette_index TSAPointer_index

3. Process BGImages as with skill anims
  use grit, incbin the image, palette, tsa and set up event file.
  Write to free space under labels TSA, Palette, Image

4. Process ObjImages (fg and bg)
  generate the oam and store it uncompressed as a list of 12-byte things
  (do it for both left and right)
  Need to do:
    take the image and split into two images, fg and bg.
    Count the used tiles for each, make sure total is less than 128
    set the index of the first one.
    calculate optimum oam, set the vram and such
    Write them to free space under labels RTLFG, LTRFG, RTLBG, LTRBG, Palette

5. create the table, set the CSA table entry.
  #define setCSATable(index, framedata, RTLFG, LTRFG, RTLBG, LTRBG) "PUSH; ORG CSATable+(index*20); POIN framedata RTLFG LTRFG RTLBG LTRBG; POP"
  #define setCustomSpell(index) "PUSH; ORG SpellTable+(index*4); POIN CSAEngine; POP"
